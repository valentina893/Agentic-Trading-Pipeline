The bridge, built more than two centuries ago, suffered damage from harsh winters and heavy rains, making it unsafe for frequent use. Volunteers from the community are working together on weekends, using both traditional masonry techniques and modern tools to preserve its original charm while ensuring durability. The effort has also sparked renewed interest in local history, as younger generations learn about the bridgeâ€™s role in trade and travel long ago.")
